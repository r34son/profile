# https://pnpm.io/npmrc#public-hoist-pattern
# Unlike hoist-pattern, which hoists dependencies to a hidden modules directory inside the virtual store, 
# public-hoist-pattern hoists dependencies matching the pattern to the root modules directory. 
# Hoisting to the root modules directory means that application code will have access to phantom dependencies, 
# even if they modify the resolution strategy improperly.
# This setting is useful when dealing with some flawed pluggable tools that don't resolve dependencies properly.

# Set to false to suppress the update notification when using an older version of pnpm than the latest.

# https://pnpm.io/7.x/npmrc#use-lockfile-v6
# Use the new v6 lockfile format, which will be the default one in pnpm v8. 
# This new format is more readable as it doesn't use hashes to shorten long dependency paths.
